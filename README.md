 ResNet-50 is a CNN(convolutional neural network) that is 50 layers deep. we can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, birds and many animals.

## Deployment

Everything you need to get started. Google Cloud. Start building right away on our secure, intelligent platform. New customers can use a $300 free credit to get started with any Google Cloud.

# Step 0: 

<b>Activate Cloud Shell</b>
![](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/vdY5e%2Fan9ZGXw5a%2FZMb1agpXhRGozsOadHURcR8thAQ%3D)

In the Cloud Console, in the top right toolbar, click the Activate Cloud Shell button.
<b>after that Click Continue.</b>

# step 1
## clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/vivolscute/resnet50-Deep-Learning-image-classifier.git
```
Change directory into  <i>resnet50-Deep-Learning-image-classifier</i>

```
cd resnet50-Deep-Learning-image-classifier
```


```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Authenticate API Requests

Set an environment variable for [YOUR_PROJECT_ID], replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your own project ID:

```
export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```
Create a Service Account to access the Google Cloud APIs when testing locally:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create resnet50 \
  --display-name "My GCP Account"```

```

Give your newly created Service Account appropriate permissions:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
--member serviceAccount:resnet50@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
--role roles/owner
```
After creating your Service Account, create a Service Account key:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json \
--iam-account resnet50@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/${USER}/key.json"
```

## Run tests

create environment

```python
virtualenv -p python3 env
```
activate the environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```
# install libraries
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Creating an App Engine App
create an App Engine instance by using:
```
gcloud app create
```
## Create a Storage BucketCreating a Storage Bucket

```
export CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=${PROJECT_ID}
```

## create a bucket
 ```
 gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}
 ```

## Running the Application
Execute the following command to start your application:
```
python main.py
```
Once the application starts, click on the Web Preview icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar and choose "Preview on port 8080."
